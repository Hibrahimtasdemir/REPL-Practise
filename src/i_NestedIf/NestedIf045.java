		// Initialize a scanner object.
		// Create an if condition: if user enters a number and it is even, print
		// that "Value is even".
		// If the above mentioned statement is true then create a nested if
		// condition to see if the value is greater than 100.
		// If the value is greater than 100, then print "Value is too large", else
		// print "Value is just right".
		// For the first if condition create an else and if the value is less than
		// 100 then print "Value is just right and is an odd number", else
		// "This is an odd number and value is too high"

		// Output:

		// If user enters 2 print"Value is even" and print for the nested if
		// "Value is just right"

		// If user enters 102 "Value is even" and print for the nested if
		// "Value is too large"

		// Now try and figure out how you would do the else condition for the first
		// if you created
